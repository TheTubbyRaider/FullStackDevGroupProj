I looked over the project requirements and scope for Handcrafted Haven. I outlined the key functionalities of the web application, focusing on seller profiles, product listings, reviews and ratings, and adherence to web development standards. Additionally, we brainstormed ideas for the design elements, emphasizing responsiveness, accessibility, and branding consistency.

CSS Theme Design Summary: For the CSS theme design, I decided to create a visually appealing yet minimalist interface that highlights the handcrafted items showcased on the platform. I will use a soft, neutral color palette to complement the vibrant colors of the artisan products. Typography will be clean and easily readable, enhancing the user experience. The layout will be responsive to ensure seamless navigation across various devices.
